# Image Processor
A small raw C++ project for processing 24-bit BMPs, with the ability to apply various available filters to the picture.

# Overall Prewiew
To process an image, you must specify the path to the input/output file, the names of the applied filters and the corresponding arguments to them.

There is help to get acquainted with the available filters.

# Description
The main advantages of this project:
1) Implement non-trivial filters (Gaussian blur)
2) Competent architecture: filter factory implemented
3) Parser coverage with tests

# Project Improvement Plans
Add the ability to work with other image formats, with the help of other libraries, speed up the work of some heavy filters.
